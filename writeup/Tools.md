# Tools

## Mobile Apps

 - **NFC Tools** (Android / iOS): Used for reading early reading and on occasional reads, when other tools are not available.

## Hardware
  - **Flipper Zero**: Current tool for reading and collecting the NFC data. There was no encryption or protection detected or cracked. All readings were done using the built-in NFC module, and no modifications were necessary.

## Software
  - **Flipper Zero NFC App**: Used for reading and storing the raw NFC data from
  - **CyberChef**: Used in the analysis process for decoding the hex values in the raw NFC dumps. Later uses may be added if necessary.
  - **qFlipper**: File export

## Knowledge Bases
  - **Deutsche Bahn documentation**: Theses official documents were found during searches using search engines and social media (Reddit). The access was open, and so far no restrictions or legal markings were found.
  - **Wikipedia**: Basically the biggest source of general and public knowledge.
  - **People**: A big shoutout goes to [@anonymos3584](https://github.com/anonymos3584) for helping me with the identification and research deep dive. Maybe more people will be added in the future.
  - **Forums and Communities**: As seen in the public knowledge document, there are different kinds of NFC tags used by the DB. I've used different forums to get more information on the identification system. Sadly, I'm not very knowledgable in DB internal or international/European train systems, so help from others was necessary.

## Future
  - Maybe I'm going to write some emails to Bewegt (rail way group for Baden Württemberg) or DB for more information and confirmation of the findings.
  - Legal disclaimer check: I'm **not** a lawyer. I'm just a hobbyist doing research on my own time. I'm going to try to get into contact with some more knowledgeable people here in Germany to confirm that my research and actions are legal and allowed. If you are a lawyer or know one, please contact me. I'm happy to get help here.
  - Get more people involved in the research and confirmation of the findings. Maybe even DB employees or people working in the train system. It would be awesome to get some more information. But please do it in a legal and respectful way.
