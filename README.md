# NFCBahn

## Description
This repo is about the decoding of the NFC tags used by the Deutsche Bahn in different trains.
So far, they have been spotted in DB Regio / RB / Regional Bahn (regional trains).

## Motivation
I've started this project as a random idea. The main point in it is trying to figure out how those tags could be used, and how they help the DB.
Most of the informations I've gathered so far are public knowledge, and from readings of the tags (public and private).

## General Information

You can find the following information in the `writeup` folder:
  - raw NFC data
  - collected public knowledge (only specifically for the uses and locations of the NFC tags in DB trains)
  - tools used
  - the research happening

## Use of AI (and why you shouldn't use it for this)

Don't use AI to research or write texts for this. It doesn't help.
I tried it myself, and it hallucinated in too many cases, and there is nearly no public information to the tags found in DB trains.
I want to keep this project clean, and free from false information. The only information you can get is through direct research,
asking, and having insider or public knowledge.
