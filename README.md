# NFCBahn

## Description
This repo is about the decoding of the NFC tags used by the Deutsche Bahn in different trains.
So far, they have been spotted in DB Regio / RB / Regional Bahn (regional trains).

## Motivation
I've started this project as a random idea. The main point in it is trying to figure out how those tags could be used, and how they help the DB.
Most of the informations I've gathered so far are public knowledge, and from readings of the tags (public and private).

## General Information
At the moment, all collected information are being stored in the folder "writeup".
